    <p>
      The USB-Mux uses analog switches and power transistors to create
      connections between its various ports. It allows workflows like connecting
      your host to the device port to write data to a connected flash
      drive before connecting the DUT to the device port to boot from said
      drive. Or it allows you to connect your DUT to the host port to test the
      DUT in its device role.
